COMET Members Information
=========================

Publishing your data on CEDA Archive
------------------------------------

This section will show how to publish your data at CEDA Archive,
get DOI and direct link, and what to do further
(basically, we encourage you to have COMET results shared through EPOS system, just let us know)

steps
^^^^^
1. Organise your data on ``Jasmin``, and add a ``readme.txt`` to introduce your file structure, e.g.,
   ``/gws/nopw/j04/nceo_geohazards_vol1/public/LiCSAR_products/derived_products/Turkey_earthquake/v1.0``
2. Contact CEDA for a ``metadata.yaml`` template. The current point of contact is ``Edward Williamson - STFC UKRI <edward.williamson@stfc.ac.uk>``. 
3. Place the completed ``metadata.yaml`` under the same directory and give Ed permission by typing ``chmod -R 777 * ``
4. Ed would prepare the online archive and send you a preview, e.g.,
   ``https://data.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/comet/publications_data/Turkey_earthquake/v1.0``
   ``https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/df93e92a3adc46b9a5c4bd3a547cd242``
5. After you've proofread the content, Ed will issue a DOI.
