Website dedicated to the COMET LiCSAR system that generates interferometric products from Sentinel-1 satellite mission.
The primary objective of LiCSAR is to measure and monitor terrain deformation over tectonic and volcanic areas,
and provide relevant and timely information to Earth-centered researchers.

Our data are freely available through the `COMET LiCSAR Portals <https://comet.nerc.ac.uk/COMET-LiCS-portal/>`_.
For more information about the LiCSAR products, please visit `LiCSAR Product Details <https://comet.nerc.ac.uk/comet-lics-portal-product-details/>`_.
Here we focus on the `LiCSAR processing architecture <https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/15/2430>`_, document some of the tools that might be of general interest, and provide necessary information for our students and postdocs.
